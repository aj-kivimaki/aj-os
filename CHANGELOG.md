## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Context Builder foundation (SPEC-002, Milestone 1) — the first platform service module (`src/context-builder/`), exposing immutable platform contracts and core services through a single public entry point:
  - Public configuration contract and `createContextBuilder()` factory (CB-002)
  - Context Package contract implementing AJS-002 Appendix B (CB-003)
  - Knowledge Provider contracts — `KnowledgeRequest`, `KnowledgeItem`, `KnowledgeProvider` (CB-004)
  - Immutable Provider Registry via `createProviderRegistry()` (CB-005)
  - Contract-testing foundation (Vitest, `npm test`) targeting the module's public surface (CB-006)
- Context Builder knowledge collection (SPEC-002, Milestone 2) — the module's first platform *behaviour*: deterministic, partial knowledge collection, built on the frozen Milestone 1 contracts:
  - Collection Engine service via `createCollectionEngine()` (CB-007)
  - Collection Error contract — `CollectionError`, `parseCollectionError()`, closed `FAILURE_CATEGORIES` (CB-008)
  - Collection Result contract — `CollectionResult` aggregating items + errors, `parseCollectionResult()` (CB-009)
  - Deterministic partial provider execution — `CollectionEngine.collect()`; a single provider failure never aborts collection and registry order is authoritative (CB-010)
  - End-to-end Context Builder collection pipeline — `ContextBuilder.collect()` (CB-011)
  - Permanent collection behaviour tests; the suite grew from 63 → 119 tests (CB-012)
- Context Builder knowledge selection (SPEC-002, Milestone 3) — the module's second platform *behaviour*: deterministic knowledge selection over the immutable `CollectionResult`, built on the frozen Milestone 1/2 contracts and introducing no new provider execution or collection:
  - Selection Engine service via `createSelectionEngine()` (CB-013)
  - SelectionResult contract — `SelectionResult` (ordered `selectedItems` + `excludedItems` + provenance metadata), `parseSelectionResult()`; the canonical ordering of `selectedItems` is the contract and there is no explicit priority field (CB-014)
  - Deterministic Selection Policy — an executable comparator chain terminating in an immutable identifier (`KnowledgeItem.id`), with evaluation, filtering, and exact-duplicate elimination; no scoring algorithms or ranking heuristics (CB-015)
  - Selection execution — `SelectionEngine.select()` applies the policy to a `CollectionResult` and returns an immutable `SelectionResult` (CB-016)
  - End-to-end Context Builder selection pipeline — `ContextBuilder.build(request)` runs Collection → Selection and returns the `SelectionResult` unchanged (CB-017)
  - Permanent selection behaviour and `build()` pipeline tests; the suite grew from 119 → 160 tests (CB-018)

### Changed

- `createContextBuilder(config)` → `createContextBuilder(config, registry)` — the factory now takes a required Provider Registry, from which it composes the Collection Engine it owns (SPEC-002, CB-011; a reviewed, approved contract evolution)
- `ContextBuilder.collect(request)` → `ContextBuilder.build(request)` — the Context Builder now exposes a single public pipeline entry point, `build(request)`, which runs Collection → Selection and returns the `SelectionResult` unchanged; the Milestone 2 collection behaviour is preserved unchanged as the internal `CollectionEngine.collect(request)` stage operation (SPEC-002, CB-017; a reviewed, approved public API evolution)
- REST API server built on Fastify (`npm run serve`), the first runtime interface alongside the sync CLI
- `GET /health` liveness endpoint
- Handbook AI agent (Claude, via `POST /agent/ask`) that answers questions grounded in the handbook wiki using a tool-use loop
- Handbook capability layer (`src/handbook/`) with path-safe, wiki-scoped reads and inbox-scoped writes, reused by the agent and the API
- Inbox capture endpoints `POST /inbox/note` and `POST /inbox/file` for writing to the handbook `workspace/inbox/`
- Bearer-token authentication (`API_AUTH_TOKEN`) on all API routes except `/health`
- n8n workflows for driving the agent from a chat window and from a phone via Telegram (`infrastructure/n8n/workflows/`)
- Agent/API configuration (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, `HANDBOOK_PATH`, `API_PORT`, `API_HOST`, `API_AUTH_TOKEN`) and `serve` / `serve:prod` scripts

### Planned

- Repository integration and Notion-backed business endpoints (Projects, Portfolio, CRM, Dashboard, Business Health)
- Additional Business Rules
- Morning Brief
- Automation
- Analytics
- Additional business modules
